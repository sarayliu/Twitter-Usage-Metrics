1790.  As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks - Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible!
1791.  Democrats used to support border security — now they want illegals to pour through our borders.
1792.  Democrats jeopardizing the safety of our troops to bail out their donors from insurance companies. It is time to put #AmericaFirst??
1793.  What's more important? Rebuilding our military - or bailing out insurance companies? Ask the Democrats.
1794.  I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border. Democrats want to shut down the government. Politics!
1795.  I want to help our miners while the Democrats are blocking their healthcare.
1796.  The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure. NO!
1797.  ...subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA. Relationships are good-deal very possible!
1798.  I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate. I agreed..
1799.  Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars. Sad!

https://t.co/rYYp51mxDQ https://t.co/np7KYHglSv
1804.  The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly.
1805.  ...the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%). They used to call this "judge shopping!" Messy system.
1806.  Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the "ban" case and now the "sanctuary" case is brought in ...
1807.  First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!

1810.  Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.
1811.  Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!

1820.  New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative. Would still beat Hillary in .....
1821.  Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.
1822.  The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.
1823.  ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.
1824.  Thank you Lake Worth, Florida. @foxandfriends
1825.  Very interesting election currently taking place in France.

1850.  Just learned that Jon @Ossoff, who is running for Congress in Georgia, doesn't even live in the district. Republicans, get out and vote!
1851.  Republicans must get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6. Force runoff and easy win! Dem Ossoff will raise your taxes-very bad on crime & 2nd A.
1852.  Democrat Jon Ossoff would be a disaster in Congress. VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes. Say NO
1853.  I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends by @ainsleyearhardt starting at 6:00 A.M. Enjoy!
1854.  The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!
1855.  With eleven Republican candidates running in Georgia (on Tuesday) for Congress, a runoff will be a win. Vote "R" for lower taxes & safety!

1860.  The Fake Media (not Real Media) has gotten even worse since the election. Every story is badly slanted. We have to hold them to the truth!
1861.  A great book for your reading enjoyment: "REASONS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS" by Michael J. Knowles.
1862.  "The first 90 days of my presidency has exposed the total failure of the last eight years of foreign policy!" So true. @foxandfriends
1863.  The recent Kansas election (Congress) was a really big media event, until the Republicans won. Now they play the same game with Georgia-BAD!
1864.  Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before. Frankly, we have no choice!
